The basics of pizza are simple. There is dough. There is topping. There is a hot oven. There is a surface in the oven on which you will cook the dough and the topping. There is a tool to transfer the uncooked pizza from your countertop to the oven, and to pull the finished pie from the oven.

The total costs associated with all this can be minimal or gigantic, depending on your frame of reference. Mario Batali, the restaurateur and television personality, has a wood-fired pizza oven on his vacation property in Michigan. He imported it from Italy. R. J. Cutler, the garrulous Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker and pizza fanatic, had one put into his outdoor kitchen in the Hollywood Hills, where he cooks for friends. You can buy a gas-fired pizza oven from Williams-Sonoma for $6,795 and a flat-rate delivery fee of $299.

That’s the high end of the cost spectrum. The recipes we are going to work with for this exercise require only the oven most of us already have in our homes. Additional cost: $0.

Unless you intend to adorn your pizzas with truffles and gold leaf, the dough and toppings won’t run you more than a few dollars, at most, per pizza made.

A pizza stone, which is the surface upon which the pie is cooked, costs around $40 at most kitchenware stores and online, and a steel version, which heats more quickly, costs perhaps twice that, but is still less expensive than a decent frying pan or knife. You can easily cut costs, though, by buying 6-inch-by-6-inch unglazed quarry tiles at your local building supply store for roughly $2 a tile. Six of these make a fine cooking surface. You could get by with four. Whichever stone or steel you use, preheat the oven at its highest temperature for at least an hour.
